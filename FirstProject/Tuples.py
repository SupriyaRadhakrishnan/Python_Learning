coordinates = (4,5)
# Tuples are constants or immutables. They cannot be changed
#coordinates[1] = 10 throws an error
print(coordinates[0])
coordinates1 = [(4,5) ,(9,0),(5,6)] # List of Tuples 
#Tuples and List  - Basic diff is that one is mutable and one is not .
#Tuple data is like final Keyword  in Java
